# Querying Couchbase Analytics via cb-analytics-mcp

You have **five SQL++ tools** for talking to the Analytics service. Picking
the right one matters — they have different cost profiles, rate-limit
budgets, and result shapes.

| Tool | Cost | Result shape | When to reach for it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execute_query` | high (full result) | rows, may be truncated | DDL, mutations, small SELECTs |
| `execute_query_readonly` | high (full result), **cached** | rows, may be truncated, `cached: bool` | repeated SELECTs in an investigation loop |
| `execute_query_paginated` | constant per page | first page + handle | SELECTs that might return many rows |
| `fetch_next_page` | constant per page | next page for a handle | follow-up to paginated |
| `explain_query` | tiny (no execution) | query plan | "why is this slow" |

## Which "Analytics" this skill covers

The tools in this skill talk to the **Analytics Service running inside a
Couchbase Server or Capella operational cluster** (the `cbas` service). That
service still ships in Couchbase Server 8.0.

Two *separate* Couchbase products also carry the Analytics name. Their tool
surface, RBAC roles, and namespace terms differ from what is documented below,
so if the user is on one of them, say so rather than guessing:

| Product | What it is | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Capella Analytics** | Couchbase's managed analytical database (RT-OLAP). **Renamed from "Capella Columnar" in August 2025** — "Capella Columnar" is a retired name; do not use it. | `https://docs.couchbase.com/analytics/` |
| **Couchbase Enterprise Analytics** | The self-managed/on-prem standalone analytical database. 2.0 GA August 2025; **2.2 is current** (2.2.1 July 2026). | `https://docs.couchbase.com/enterprise-analytics/current/` |

These are different deployments of a related capability, not synonyms for each
other and not synonyms for the in-cluster Analytics Service.

Analytics."; Enterprise Analytics release notes

## The cardinal rule: pick the tool that matches what you'll do with the result

If you only need the **first N rows** to answer the user's question, use
`execute_query_paginated` with `page_size=N`. Don't pull a million rows
through the MCP boundary just to take the first 20.

If you need to **show the user the data** (and the dataset is small),
`execute_query_readonly` is fine — but watch for `truncated: true` in the
response.

If you need to **make a decision** based on aggregates (`COUNT`, `SUM`,
`AVG`, `GROUP BY`), the result is small by construction. Use
`execute_query_readonly` and benefit from the cache.

## The soft cap (you will see `truncated: true`)

Both `execute_query` and `execute_query_readonly` enforce a server-side row
cap (default 1000, configurable via `MAX_QUERY_ROWS`). Responses include:

- `truncated: true` if the cap kicked in
- `row_cap`: the cap that was applied (or `null` if disabled)
- `full_row_count`: how many rows the cluster actually had

When you see `truncated: true`, **do not silently report incomplete data**.
Either:

1. Tell the user the result is truncated and ask if they want all rows
   (then re-issue as paginated), or
2. If you only needed a sample, acknowledge it and continue ("here are the
   first 1000 of 47,832 matching rows").

The user is operating an LLM-driven tool. Hidden truncation will eventually
produce wrong answers.

## The cache (you will see `cached: true`)

`execute_query_readonly` results are cached for ~60 seconds keyed by
`(cluster, statement, scan_consistency)`. Responses include `cached: true`
on a cache hit, `cached: false` on a miss. Practical implications:

- Repeating an identical query inside an investigation loop is free; lean
  into it.
- If freshness matters (e.g. you're watching an ingestion catch up), add
  `scan_consistency="request_plus"` so the cache key differs from the
  default-consistency cached entry.
- If you need a definitively fresh read, use `execute_query` (uncached) or
  wait 60s.

## Pagination, end-to-end

```python
# 1. First page
first = execute_query_paginated(
    statement="SELECT id, name, status FROM Default.Orders WHERE region = $r",
    named_args={"r": "EMEA"},
    page_size=100,
)
handle = first["data"]["pagination_handle"]
# Use first["data"]["results"] — that's your page 0

# 2. Walk pages until exhausted
while first["data"]["has_more"]:
    nxt = fetch_next_page(pagination_handle=handle)
    # Process nxt["data"]["results"]
    if not nxt["data"]["has_more"]:
        break
    handle = nxt["data"]["pagination_handle"]  # handle stays the same; this is for clarity
```

Important details:

- `page_size` must be between 1 and 10000. Default 100.
- A trailing `LIMIT/OFFSET` clause in your statement gets **stripped** —
  the server adds its own.
- Handles expire after 30 minutes of inactivity. If you get
  `"not found or expired"`, just call `execute_query_paginated` again to
  start fresh.
- When `has_more` is `false`, the handle is auto-dropped on the server.
  Don't call `fetch_next_page` again with it.
- `total_seen` accumulates across pages; use it for progress reporting.

## EXPLAIN — your slow-query diagnostic

```python
plan = explain_query(statement="SELECT * FROM Default.Orders WHERE customer_id = 'C-1234'")
# plan["data"]["plan"] is the service-internal JSON plan
```

When to reach for `explain_query`:

- The user reports a slow query.
- You ran a query and `data.metrics.executionTime` was surprising.
- The user asks "is this query using an index?"
- You're about to recommend adding an index — check first that the planner
  isn't already using one.

You don't have to add `EXPLAIN` to your statement; the tool prepends it if
not present.

## Namespace terminology (do not conflate with the Data service)

The Analytics namespace is **its own hierarchy**, not the operational one:

- **In-cluster Analytics Service**: Cluster -> Analytics Scope -> Analytics
  Collection. `DATAVERSE` is still valid DDL and is documented as a **synonym
  for `ANALYTICS SCOPE`** — the metadata collection is still
  ``Metadata.`Dataverse` ``. Prefer "Analytics scope" in prose; keep `dataverse`
  where it is the literal tool/DDL keyword. Source:
  `https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/analytics/5_ddl.html`
- **Capella Analytics / Enterprise Analytics**: Cluster -> **Database** ->
  **Scope** -> **Collection**, and the docs there no longer use "dataverse" in
  user-facing prose (metadata still exposes ``System.Metadata.`Dataverse` `` as
  *scope* metadata). Source:
  `https://docs.couchbase.com/analytics/sources/database-objects.html`

Neither is the same thing as the Data service's Bucket -> Scope -> Collection.
An Analytics scope/collection may *mirror* a Data service scope/collection via a
link, but it is a distinct object with its own name, privileges and lifecycle.
Never tell a user that an Analytics collection "is" a bucket collection.

## Parameterisation rules (still apply)

Never interpolate user-controlled values into the statement string. Use
`named_args`:

```python
execute_query(
    statement="SELECT * FROM Default.Orders o WHERE o.customer_id = $cust",
    named_args={"cust": "C-1234"},
)
```

Identifiers (dataset names, field names) **can't** be parameterised by
SQL++. If you must inject one, validate it first (the server already does
this for `infer_schema`).

Note: `execute_query_paginated` also accepts `named_args` and
`positional_args`. Parameter values are reused across pages — no need to
re-pass them to `fetch_next_page`.

## Scan consistency

The Analytics Service supports **exactly two** scan-consistency settings:

- `not_bounded` (default) — the query runs immediately against whatever the
  Analytics datasets currently hold; results may be stale.
- `request_plus` — the datasets are first updated with the data available from
  the Data service at the time of the request, then the query runs. Use when
  correctness matters more than latency.

**There is no `at_plus` for Analytics.** The docs are explicit: "The Analytics
Service API does not support the `at_plus` or `statement_plus` settings for
scan consistency." The Analytics Service also ignores the Query service's
`prepared` parameter. If a user asks for `at_plus` against Analytics, tell them
it is a Query-service-only option — `at_plus` exists on the Query service, not
here. The SDK enum confirms the same two values (`NOT_BOUNDED`,
`REQUEST_PLUS`).

Source: `https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/analytics/query-params.html`
and `AnalyticsScanConsistency` in the Java SDK API reference.

`scan_consistency` is part of the cache key for `execute_query_readonly`.
Changing it gives you a fresh read without bypassing the cache for other
callers.

## Result shape

All five tools return `{ok, data, cluster}`. The `data` object's common
fields:

| Field | execute_query | _readonly | _paginated | fetch_next_page | explain |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `results` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (page) | ✓ (page) | — |
| `plan` | — | — | — | — | ✓ |
| `metrics` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `warnings` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `request_id`, `status` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `truncated`, `row_cap`, `full_row_count` | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| `cached` | — | ✓ | — | — | — |
| `pagination_handle`, `page_size`, `page_offset`, `rows_returned`, `has_more` | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| `total_seen` | — | — | — | ✓ | — |

Always surface `data.warnings` to the user verbatim. The Analytics Service
returns non-fatal problems as warnings rather than errors, so a query can
"succeed" and still have something worth reading in that array.

## Rate limits & safety

Query tools share a single token bucket per API key, category `"query"`,
default 10 requests/sec. That means **all five query tools together**
contribute to the same budget, not 10/sec each.

If you hit the limit:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "RateLimitExceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded for category 'query' (limit 10/sec). Retry in 0.41s.",
  "category": "query", "rate_per_sec": 10, "retry_after_sec": 0.41 }
```

Honour `retry_after_sec`. Don't retry-storm — the bucket only refills at
the rate, so hammering it just keeps failing. Better: explain to the user
what happened ("hit the query rate limit, waiting half a second") and back
off.

Caching helps: every cache hit on `execute_query_readonly` does not
consume a token. So in investigative loops, the second-and-onward hits of
the same query are free both for the cluster and for the rate budget.

## Common patterns

### Counting documents

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(*) FROM Default.Users
```

Use `execute_query_readonly`. Tiny result, cacheable, almost free.

### Schema discovery

Prefer the `infer_schema` tool (separate skill) over
`SELECT VALUE OBJECT_NAMES(d) FROM x d`; it returns a typed summary
including presence rates. Note: `infer_schema` runs a SELECT under the
hood so it counts against the same `"query"` rate-limit category.

### Working with multiple clusters

Always pass `cluster="..."` if there's any ambiguity. Use `list_clusters`
first if you don't know what's configured.

### Diagnosing slow queries

1. `get_active_requests` — see what's running now.
2. `get_completed_requests` — recent history with timings.
3. `explain_query(stmt)` — show the plan, look for full scans.
4. If the plan looks fine but the query is still slow, check
   `get_service_status` for resource pressure.

## What to avoid

- Don't run `SELECT *` against multi-million-row datasets via
  `execute_query`. Use `execute_query_paginated` with a reasonable
  `page_size` (100–1000) instead. The soft cap will catch you anyway,
  but using the right tool is cleaner.
- Don't use `request_plus` on hot-path queries unless the freshness is
  actually needed. It defeats both the in-memory cache and Analytics'
  internal optimisations.
- Don't drop or replace datasets without checking `get_active_requests`
  first — in-flight queries against the target will fail.
- Don't silently ignore `truncated: true`. The user is operating an
  LLM-driven tool; hidden truncation produces wrong answers.
- Don't keep paginating "to see if there's more" if `has_more` is `false`.
  The handle is dropped server-side; the next call returns an error.
- Don't reach for `execute_query` (uncached, full result) when
  `execute_query_readonly` would do. The cache pays for itself within two
  identical calls.
