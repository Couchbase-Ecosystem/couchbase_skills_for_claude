# Couchbase data modeling

A skill for *designing* what to put in Couchbase, not operating an existing cluster. The companion `couchbase-mcp` skill is for executing operations; this one is for the architectural decisions that come before any tool is called.

Covers Couchbase Server 7.x and 8.x, and Capella. Version- and edition-specific behaviour is gated inline — several things that matter for modelling (Magma, Analytics, Eventing, vector indexes) are **Enterprise Edition only and not available in Community Edition**.

Terminology used throughout: **Bucket → Scope → Collection**; **SQL++** for the query language; **GSI** for global secondary indexes; **the Search Service** for full-text and hybrid search; **Capella** for the cloud service. The standalone analytics products are **Capella Analytics** (cloud) and **Couchbase Enterprise Analytics** (self-managed); the in-cluster **Analytics service** ships with Couchbase Server EE.

## When this skill applies

Use this skill whenever the conversation is about *what shape the data should take*, not *what tool to call*. Concrete signals:

- "How should I model X in Couchbase?"
- "Should I embed this or use references?"
- "What's the right key format?"
- "Bucket vs scope vs collection?"
- "I'm coming from [MongoDB / Postgres / DynamoDB] — how do I think about this?"
- "How do I model time-series / events / logs?"
- "Where do I put the embedding vector?"
- "Schema migration in Couchbase?"

If the conversation has already moved to "now run this tool," switch to `couchbase-mcp`. These skills are designed to compose — modeling first, then operation.

## Pick the right reference

| Question | Read |
|---|---|
| "What should my keys look like?" | `references/keys.md` |
| "Should I embed or reference?" / "How big should one document be?" | `references/document-shape.md` |
| "Bucket vs scope vs collection?" | `references/boundaries.md` |
| "How do I model for fast queries / search / vector search?" | `references/access-patterns.md` |
| "Time-series, event logs, anything with timestamps and TTL" | `references/time-series-and-ttl.md` |
| "I think I'm doing something wrong" | `references/anti-patterns.md` |
| "I'm coming from a relational DB, MongoDB, or DynamoDB" | `references/migration-from-relational.md` |

Each reference is self-contained with a decision tree at the end.

## The five-question design pass

Before reaching for any reference, walk the user through these five questions. The answers determine which references matter and which patterns apply:

1. **What does the application read most often?** Read patterns drive denormalization. The data you fetch together should live together.
2. **What changes together?** Write patterns drive document boundaries. Things that change together should be in the same document, OR separate documents with a transactional update path.
3. **What's the unit of access?** A document is the atomic unit in Couchbase. If you frequently need a subset of a "document," it's probably actually multiple documents.
4. **What's the lifespan?** Permanent data, session data with TTL, time-series with rolling windows — these belong in different collections or even buckets.
5. **What's the worst-case query?** The slowest legitimate query in your workload defines your indexing strategy and possibly your modeling choices.

Don't skip this pass even on "simple" cases. The most common modeling failure is jumping to "I'll just put it all in one document" before thinking about (1) and (4).

## Three core principles

**Principle 1 — Model the read, not the write.**
If you fetch user + their last 10 orders together 95% of the time, embed (or denormalize) the orders. The 5% write cost is worth the 95% read win. The opposite is also true: if you write to orders 100× per read of user+orders, separate them so you're not rewriting the user doc on every order.

**Principle 2 — A document is the atomic unit.**
Couchbase guarantees atomicity at the document level for KV operations. Spanning multiple documents requires a distributed ACID transaction (via the SDKs, or `BEGIN TRANSACTION` in SQL++), which is slower than a plain KV write. If two things MUST stay consistent, either put them in one document or accept the transaction cost.

A single document is capped at **20 MB**, and a document key at **250 bytes**. Both are hard limits — a model that approaches either is already the wrong model. See `document-shape.md` and `keys.md`.

**Principle 3 — Boundaries are about lifecycle, not topic.**
Use buckets for fundamentally different lifecycles (different memory budget, replica count, eviction policy). Use scopes for multi-tenant or multi-environment separation. Use collections for type-grouped documents within a tenant. Mind the documented ceilings: **up to 30 buckets per cluster**, and **up to 1000 scopes and 1000 collections per cluster**. See `references/boundaries.md`.

## Common shapes to recognize

The user is often describing one of these shapes without knowing the canonical name:

| User says | Pattern name | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| "Each user has a list of orders" | One-to-many (embed vs reference) | `document-shape.md` |
| "Each order has line items" | Nested aggregate | `document-shape.md` |
| "Users follow other users" | Many-to-many | `document-shape.md` |
| "I want to query by [field X]" | Index-friendly modeling | `access-patterns.md` |
| "Search across descriptions / text" | Search Service modeling | `access-patterns.md` |
| "Semantic search over docs" | Vector modeling | `access-patterns.md` |
| "Log entries / metrics / events" | Time-series | `time-series-and-ttl.md` |
| "Session data that expires" | TTL-bounded | `time-series-and-ttl.md` |
| "User profiles with versioned history" | Versioned aggregate | `document-shape.md` |

## What this skill won't help with

- **Capacity planning** ("how much RAM do I need?") — that's a sizing question. Use the `couchbase-sizing` skill instead.
- **Running operations** ("create this index") — that's the `couchbase-mcp` skill.
- **Application code** — modeling is database-side; how your app code consumes the model is out of scope here.

Hand off explicitly when a conversation crosses these lines.
