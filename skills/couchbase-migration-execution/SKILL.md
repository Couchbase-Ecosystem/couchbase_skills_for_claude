# Couchbase migration execution

A skill for *executing* data migrations into Couchbase — the mechanics of moving data, keeping source and target in sync during transition, validating equivalence, and switching production traffic.

Distinct from the sibling skills:
- `couchbase-data-modeling` — how to MODEL the data after migrating (document shape, boundaries, access patterns)
- `couchbase-sizing` — how to size the target cluster
- `couchbase-app-integration` — how to write app code that uses Couchbase (relevant during dual-write)
- `couchbase-mcp` — operating the cluster (creating the target, running queries during validation)
- **`couchbase-migration-execution` (this skill)** — the operational mechanics of moving data and switching over

If the conversation is "how do I get my data from X into Couchbase," this is the right skill.

## When this skill applies

- "How do I migrate from MongoDB / Postgres / DynamoDB / MySQL to Couchbase?"
- "Should I do a big-bang migration or phased?"
- "What's dual-write?"
- "How do I keep the source and target in sync during migration?"
- "Can I use CDC for this?"
- "How do I validate the migration worked?"
- "How do I cut over production traffic?"
- "What if the migration goes wrong — can I roll back?"
- "Tooling for bulk loading into Couchbase?"

## The five-question pre-migration checklist

Before any data moves, get answers to these. Without them, migrations turn into multi-week troubleshooting sessions:

1. **What's the source?** Database type, version, total size, current write rate. Different sources have very different migration shapes
2. **Can the source go offline?** If yes (planned downtime acceptable): big-bang is on the table. If no: you need dual-write or CDC
3. **What's the modeling change?** Direct table-to-collection translation or a re-model? See `couchbase-data-modeling` skill — the answer here determines whether you can use simple bulk tools or need transformation code
4. **What's the rollback bar?** If something goes wrong post-cutover, can you tolerate going back to the source (probably yes for the first hour, probably no after a week)?
5. **What's the validation plan?** Count comparison? Sample comparison? Checksum? Automated test suite? Decide before starting

If the user hasn't thought through these, walk them through them before suggesting any specific approach.

## The four migration approaches at a glance

| Approach | When it fits | Downtime | Complexity | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Big-bang** | Small data, planned downtime OK | Yes | Low | High (no rollback once cut over) |
| **Phased / table-by-table** | Multi-domain app, can migrate one slice at a time | Per-slice downtime | Medium | Medium |
| **Dual-write** | Need zero downtime, can modify app code | Zero | High | Low if done carefully |
| **CDC-based** | Need zero downtime, can deploy CDC tooling | Zero | High but mechanical | Low if validated |

`strategies.md` covers each in detail with the decision framework.

## Three principles for any migration

**Principle 1 — Validate at every step.**
A migration is only as good as your confidence that source == target. Count comparison, sample comparison, and checksum verification at each step catch problems early. Defer validation to the end and a single bad transformation can corrupt everything.

**Principle 2 — Make the cutover reversible for as long as possible.**
The first cutover should be: cut traffic to the new system, monitor for problems, cut back to source if needed. Keep source running in read-only mode for at least days, ideally weeks. The hardest migrations are the ones that decommissioned the source on day 1.

**Principle 3 — Migrations are projects, not commands.**
Even "simple" migrations from MongoDB to Couchbase typically take weeks of work: test the tooling, dry-run on a sample, validate, do a partial migration in staging, validate, set up dual-write or CDC, run for a soak period, plan cutover, execute, monitor, decommission source. Don't let the user expect "I'll just run `cbimport` and we're done."

## Common migration shapes

Recognize which shape the user is dealing with:

| Source | Typical shape | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| MongoDB → Couchbase | Schema is similar; mostly key/format mapping. `cbmigrate mongo` is purpose-built for this | `from-mongodb.md` |
| Postgres / MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle → Couchbase | Major modeling change; relational JOINs → denormalization | `from-relational.md` |
| DynamoDB → Couchbase | Schema is similar; partition-key concept maps to document key. `cbmigrate dynamodb` is purpose-built for this | `from-other-sources.md` |
| Cassandra → Couchbase | Similar to DynamoDB; wide-column → document with arrays | `from-other-sources.md` |
| Files (CSV, JSON, Parquet) → Couchbase | One-shot bulk load; `cbimport` shines | `from-other-sources.md` + `tooling.md` |
| Custom application export → Couchbase | ETL code; the source has whatever shape you wrote | Depends; usually like file load |

## What this skill won't help with

- **Designing the target model** — see `couchbase-data-modeling` for that. This skill assumes the target model is decided
- **Sizing the target cluster** — see `couchbase-sizing`. Migrations need correctly-sized target clusters; this skill assumes that's done
- **Operating the cluster** — see `couchbase-mcp`. Bucket / index / user creation on the target happens via that skill
- **Application code that uses Couchbase** — see `couchbase-app-integration`. The dual-write phase needs application code; this skill references the patterns but the SDK details live there
- **Couchbase Mobile / Sync Gateway migrations** — different product; out of scope

Hand off explicitly when the conversation crosses these lines.

## A typical migration timeline

For a moderate-size migration (10-100 GB), expect roughly:

| Phase | Duration | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Planning | 1-2 weeks | Modeling, sizing, approach selection, validation plan |
| Tooling setup | 1 week | Install / configure cbimport, ETL framework, or CDC tool |
| Dry run on sample | 1 week | Migrate a representative subset; validate; iterate |
| Staging migration | 1 week | Full migration in staging environment; full validation |
| Dual-write setup | 1-2 weeks | App code changes for dual-write or CDC setup |
| Soak period | 2-4 weeks | Source and target in sync; validate continuously |
| Cutover | 1 day | Switch traffic; monitor |
| Soak post-cutover | 2-4 weeks | Source still running read-only; rollback possible |
| Decommission source | 1 day | After successful soak, retire the source |

**Total: 8-16 weeks** for non-trivial production migrations. Big-bang migrations on small datasets can compress to days; large active-active dual-write migrations can stretch to months.

Don't surprise the user with this timeline — set the expectation up front. Migration projects that get "we'll be done by Friday" framing fail.

## Quick decision tree

- **Source is MongoDB or DynamoDB, one-shot?** → `cbmigrate` first — it has dedicated `mongo` and `dynamodb` subcommands and does key generation and index copying for you
- **Downtime allowed, small data, file-based source?** → Big-bang with `cbimport`
- **Multi-domain app, can do it in slices?** → Phased / strangler-fig pattern
- **Live system, zero downtime, can modify app?** → Dual-write
- **Live system, zero downtime, can't modify app?** → CDC-based (Debezium, AWS DMS, etc.)
- **Source is MongoDB or DynamoDB, zero-downtime?** → `cbmigrate` for the bulk load, then CDC for the delta
- **Source is relational?** → Modeling change required; ETL code or careful CDC transformation
- **Unsure where to start?** → Read `strategies.md` and answer the five-question checklist

## Tooling ground rules

- **Verify the tool and its flags before quoting them.** CLI tools change between releases: `cbtransfer` is deprecated in favour of `cbdatarecovery`, and Couchbase recommends XDCR for live cluster-to-cluster movement. Check the [Couchbase CLI reference](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/cli/cli-intro.html) for the version the user is running rather than reciting flags from memory.
- **`cbmigrate` is a separate download**, not part of the server install — it lives at [couchbaselabs/cbmigrate](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/cbmigrate) and is documented at [cbmigrate](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/cli/cbmigrate-tool.html). It supports **MongoDB, DynamoDB and Hugging Face** sources.
- **This skill does not cover migration accelerator tooling.** That content is out of scope for this repository by standing rule; route accelerator questions to Couchbase directly.
- **Don't promise a third-party tool targets Couchbase without checking.** Managed CDC services in particular have specific supported-target lists, and Couchbase is often reached indirectly (via Kafka, or a file staging step) rather than as a first-party target.

## Version gating for migrations

- **Scopes and collections** — 7.0+. A migration into a 6.x cluster has no scope/collection layer to target
- **Magma storage engine** — Enterprise Edition only; the recommended engine as of 8.0 and the right default for a large migration target, where new EE buckets default to the 128-vBucket Magma configuration
- **Memcached buckets** — removed in 8.0; if the source system's target design assumed one, use an Ephemeral bucket
- **XDCR conflict logging** — 8.0+; useful during an active-active transition, absent on 7.x
- **Maximum 30 buckets per cluster**, so a bucket-per-source-database mapping does not scale — plan the target as scopes and collections
