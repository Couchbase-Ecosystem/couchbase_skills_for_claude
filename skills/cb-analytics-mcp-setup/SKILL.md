# cb-analytics-mcp setup

You're helping the user bring up or tune a cb-analytics-mcp installation.
This skill covers configuration, validation, and the operator CLI.

## Which "Analytics" this skill covers

The tools in this skill talk to the **Analytics Service running inside a
Couchbase Server or Capella operational cluster** (the `cbas` service). That
service still ships in Couchbase Server 8.0.

Two *separate* Couchbase products also carry the Analytics name. Their tool
surface, RBAC roles, and namespace terms differ from what is documented below,
so if the user is on one of them, say so rather than guessing:

| Product | What it is | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Capella Analytics** | Couchbase's managed analytical database (RT-OLAP). **Renamed from "Capella Columnar" in August 2025** — "Capella Columnar" is a retired name; do not use it. | `https://docs.couchbase.com/analytics/` |
| **Couchbase Enterprise Analytics** | The self-managed/on-prem standalone analytical database. 2.0 GA August 2025; **2.2 is current** (2.2.1 July 2026). | `https://docs.couchbase.com/enterprise-analytics/current/` |

These are different deployments of a related capability, not synonyms for each
other and not synonyms for the in-cluster Analytics Service.

(`https://docs.couchbase.com/analytics/release-notes/release-notes.html`) —

Analytics."; Enterprise Analytics release notes
(`https://docs.couchbase.com/enterprise-analytics/current/release-notes/release-notes.html`).

## Required env vars (server refuses to start without these)

- `MCP_API_KEY` — bearer token for Claude. **Min 32 chars.**
  Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"`
- At least one of:
  - **Single cluster**: `CB_ANALYTICS_HOST` and `CB_ANALYTICS_PASSWORD`
  - **Multi cluster**: `CB_ANALYTICS_CLUSTERS_FILE` pointing at a JSON array
- If GUI is enabled (default): `GUI_SESSION_SECRET` (≥32 chars) and a
  non-default `GUI_PASSWORD`.

## Validation flow

Always recommend `cb-analytics-mcp --check` before `make run`. It returns:

- exit 0 + a `config_valid` log line on success
- exit 2 + a list of human-readable errors on failure

`--check` doesn't try to reach the cluster. To verify network reachability
too, use the **dashboard's Test Connection button** after starting the
server (or `cb-analytics-mcp tools call ping_cluster --offline`, see CLI
section below).

## Single vs multi-cluster decision

- **One Couchbase cluster.** Use env vars only. Simpler.
- **More than one cluster** (prod, stage, dev), or **one cluster with
  separate credentials per tenant.** Use `CB_ANALYTICS_CLUSTERS_FILE`.
  The file is a JSON array; each entry has `name`, `host`, `username`,
  `password`, and optional `tls`, `mgmt_port`, `analytics_port`,
  `verify_ssl`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`. See
  `config/clusters.example.json`.

## Tunable safety limits (sensible defaults; tune only if needed)

| Env var | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_QUERY_ROWS` | `1000` | Soft cap on `execute_query` / `execute_query_readonly`. Responses include `truncated: true` and `full_row_count` when the cap kicks in. `0` disables. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_QUERY_PER_SEC` | `10` | Token-bucket rate for all query tools (per API key). |
| `RATE_LIMIT_READ_PER_SEC` | `60` | Token-bucket rate for read-only tools (list/get/ping/…). |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_PER_SEC` | `1` | Token-bucket rate for mutating tools (upsert/delete user, links, restart, capella mutations, …). Intentionally conservative. |
| `AUDIT_ROTATE_BYTES` | `10485760` (10 MB) | Rotate audit log when it exceeds this. `0` disables rotation. |
| `AUDIT_ROTATE_KEEP` | `5` | How many rotated generations to keep (`audit.log.1`…`.5`). |

These defaults are deliberate. Before raising any limit, ask: "is the
right answer actually a different architecture (caching layer, batched
query, smarter pagination), not a higher rate limit?" Raising the write
limit in particular is rarely the answer — a misbehaving client can
easily cause real harm at 10 writes/sec.

When a rate limit fires, the tool response is:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "RateLimitExceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded for category 'write' (limit 1/sec). Retry in 0.83s.",
  "category": "write", "rate_per_sec": 1, "retry_after_sec": 0.83 }
```

This is by design — the rate limits ARE the recommended behavior. They
are also recorded in the audit log as `success: false` so you can spot
abusive clients.

## The operator CLI (`cb-analytics-mcp tools …`)

For testing config or scripting workflows without going through Claude:

```bash
# Enumerate every registered tool
cb-analytics-mcp tools list

# Filter by rate-limit category
cb-analytics-mcp tools list --category write

# Offline mode: instantiates the pool in-process. No running server needed.
# Uses the same env config the server would.
cb-analytics-mcp tools call list_dataverses --offline

# Pass args. Values are JSON-parsed when possible, otherwise treated as
# strings. Nested JSON works:
cb-analytics-mcp tools call execute_query_readonly \
    --arg statement='SELECT * FROM Default.Books LIMIT 5' \
    --arg cluster=prod \
    --offline

# Against a running server (uses MCP_API_KEY as bearer):
cb-analytics-mcp tools call list_users \
    --remote http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Both modes pretty-print the JSON result and exit non-zero on tool-level
errors, so the CLI works in shell pipelines. Use it for:

- Smoke-testing config after editing `.env`
- Verifying a specific cluster is reachable (`tools call ping_cluster
  --arg cluster=NAME --offline`)
- Pre-flighting a query before wiring it into automation
- Debugging in CI

## Common gotchas

- `MCP_API_KEY` under 32 chars → ValueError at startup. Pad it.
- `GUI_PASSWORD=changeme` is rejected in strict mode (`--check` flags it).
- TLS to Couchbase: set `CB_ANALYTICS_TLS=true` **and** the correct
  TLS-port numbers. On Couchbase Server the defaults are `18091` (cluster
  management over TLS) and `18095` (Analytics Service over TLS), against
  `8091`/`8095` non-TLS. Confirm against the cluster rather than assuming —
  ports are configurable, and Capella Analytics / Enterprise Analytics
  endpoints are not reached this way at all.
- Capella tools require **both** `CB_CAPELLA_API_KEY_SECRET` and a
  working outbound HTTPS path to `cloudapi.cloud.couchbase.com`.
- The audit log writer creates its parent directory on first record. If
  the path is on a read-only mount, set `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=false` or pick
  a writable location.
- Audit rotation creates `audit.log.1`, `audit.log.2`, etc. alongside
  the active file. If your `AUDIT_LOG_FILE` is in a directory you only
  intend for the live log, the backups will end up there too. Pick a
  dedicated directory.
- Setting `MAX_QUERY_ROWS=0` to "see everything" is rarely the right call.
  The cap exists to keep wire payloads sane. If you need the full result,
  use `execute_query_paginated` instead.
- The GUI's WebSocket log streamer reads from `LOG_FILE`. If you haven't
  set `LOG_FILE`, the `/logs` page falls back to a note explaining that
  there's nothing to tail.

## What to do after a successful --check

1. `make run` to start both servers.
2. Browse to `http://localhost:8080` to confirm the GUI.
3. Click **Test** on each cluster row in the dashboard to confirm
   reachability end-to-end (or use the CLI: `cb-analytics-mcp tools call
   ping_cluster --offline`).
4. From the GUI, run `SELECT 1` in the query editor to round-trip the
   full request path.
5. Point Claude at `http://<host>:8000/mcp` with the bearer token from
   step 1 (see `connecting-claude-ai.md` in the project docs).
6. Visit `/admin` and confirm the audit log is recording your test calls.
   Use the date / tool / failures filters to verify they work.

## Troubleshooting decision tree

- **Server won't start** → run `--check`. Address every reported error.
- **Server starts but cluster shows "Unreachable"** → click Test on the
  cluster row; the inline message tells you whether it's DNS, port, TLS,
  or credentials.
- **Tools return `AnalyticsAuthError`** → credentials wrong, role missing,
  or wrong cluster. Cross-check with `tools call who_am_i --offline`.
- **Tools return `RateLimitExceeded`** → expected behavior, not a bug. This
  is *this server's* limit, not Couchbase's. Check the audit log to identify
  the noisy client; consider raising `RATE_LIMIT_*_PER_SEC` if the traffic is
  legitimate.
- **Audit log file grows without bound** → confirm `AUDIT_ROTATE_BYTES`
  is non-zero. With the defaults (10 MB, 5 kept generations) the live log plus
  its backups is bounded at roughly 60 MB.
- **WebSocket `/logs/ws` errors out** → almost always a reverse-proxy not
  upgrading; the page auto-falls back to HTMX polling, which still works.
